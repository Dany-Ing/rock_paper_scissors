This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The computer's decision is selected randomly from an array for each round and the player's decision is selected within a prompt. After each round, the scores are shown and once the game of 5 rounds is over, the player will be notified if they win or lose. Some complications: Had issues figuring out the scope of variables. 
Open console on developer tools to play game.

update #1: Added a simple UI which incorporates buttons for the user to select their choice in each round of rock paper scissors. Had some issues figuring out how to add the eventlistener to correspond with "playerSelection".
